# Challenge 19: Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Chandrashekhar G. Ranade

The objective of this Challenge is to help our client named Berk in creating a binary classifier that is capable of
predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by the Alphabet Soup. Our consultancy firm is particularly interested in this analysis since this work can also be used for the organizations like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank which lend at a low interest rate investment loans to developing countries. The experience gained here we can also use for the member countries of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and other multilateral lending organizations, including donors like the USAID.

## Apprach

We had received the code to use the Deep Learning Machine Language and were tasked to see if we could increase the accuracy rate to 75%. We tried various methods, including the one of increasing Epochs to 800 but we could increase the accuracy rate to only 73%.

## Future Work
As stated above, we will be using this method for other clients and see if we can increase the accuracy rate beyond 75% since we have access to the data on several more features related to the other clients compared to those used in Challenge 19.
